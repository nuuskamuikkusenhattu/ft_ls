1907
- supported '-a' flag
-> separated files starting with a '.' and all files into different functions (create_list.c)

- started working for -R
-> created 'recursive-print() (ft_ls.c)
-> am now able to print the first subfolder and its content. no recursion yet.

- created ft_strjoin_three (libft)

2007
- erased my recursive_print
-> i think i should list all dirs recursively on the first go, if -R present
managed to list the directories and subdirectories (i think)
> list_directories_only (list.c) AND list_sub_directories (ft_ls.c)

- -R works, sort of

2107
- am able to print file-size for -l now (long_format.c)

2207
- modified time-format printing for long-format (long_format.c) (doesnt support 6MM difference yet)

2407
- long-format supports the 6month difference now
- created sort_time (sort.c), that sorts files in an array given modification time for -t
- started working on my main.c-logic (cleaner version)
