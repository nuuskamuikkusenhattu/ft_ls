1907
- supported '-a' flag
-> separated files starting with a '.' and all files into different functions (create_list.c)

- started working for -R
-> created 'recursive-print() (ft_ls.c)
-> am now able to print the first subfolder and its content. no recursion yet.

- created ft_strjoin_three (libft)

2007
- erased my recursive_print
-> i think i should list all dirs recursively on the first go, if -R present
managed to list the directories and subdirectories (i think)
> list_directories_only (list.c) AND list_sub_directories (ft_ls.c)

- -R works, sort of

2107
- am able to print file-size for -l now (long_format.c)

2207
- modified time-format printing for long-format (long_format.c) (doesnt support 6MM difference yet)

2407
- long-format supports the 6month difference now
- created sort_time (sort.c), that sorts files in an array given modification time for -t
- started working on my main.c-logic (cleaner version)

2507
- working on my list-building + sorting + printing logic
(apparently ls looks dirty with ls -R ../init/)
- changed the way how printing from paths works
- fixed stat-function params in long_format.c
- can do -l from directory now

2607
- got -R to work (i guess) (print.c)
- changed sort_list (sort.c)
- added char sortc to build (set to 't', 'r' if no t, '0' if no r)

2707
- changed path to file-name for stat-calls in long_format.calls

2807
- moved testfiles, created script in ls_test_files
- cleaned up code, overwrote print_R (print.c) with something that seems to work

2907
- added print_link into long_format.c 
== found errors with -Rr dirre dirre/, etc. tried again with -R, theyre in ../yri2 

0108
- redid -R (recursion.c), works with -Rr now

0208
- fixed -t by adding sort_ascii -call before it (sort.c)
- added output for no_permission
- added support for stickybits (long_format.c)

0308
- added sort_rt (sort.c), doesnt QUITE work tho

0508
- quite dumb special case for -Rrt done, seems to work now
- added setuid/setgid, block- and character-files 
- added major / minor number for device files (/dev) (long_format.c)

0808
- fixed total-counter for -l
- new error-message for too long of a filename
- support for files with a future timestamp

0908
- changed -R to be recursive, with help of Atte<3
- fixed -r to always do either sort_ascii or sort_time first, and complete reverse after

1008
- created sort_by_time that takes path as param
- fixed print_files_only (and functions that call it) to work with correct path
- fixed bug regarding links to folders that dont have permissions

1108
- fixed total stblock to only be printed when listing dir content
- fixed permission-detail with invalid paths
- fixed -Ss and -Tt differences for long_format.c 
- added BONUS -d, that lists plain dir-names
- added BONUS -f, that doesnt sort the list, and turns -a option on
- added BONUS -i, that prints the file serial number
- added BONUS option -o, that prints long_format without group_id
- added BONUS option -T, that prints the full date with long_format (without day of the week)

1508
- added ACL bonuses

1608
- added nanosecond comparison for -t
- fixed -R to stop listing dirs at given point 
- fixed floating point error (division with 0) for column division 
- fixed path-creation to stop adding unwanted '/'s
- added permission_denied_error -function (list.c) to support edgecases
- started to fixed normi, split functions, removed unused functions 

1708
- changed some function declarations and created new ones in long_format.c (_helper.c) to pass norm

1808
- fixed mallocing
- fixed leaks
- fixed major bug with -l

1908
- added bonus option -1
- fixed total-count condition for -l

2208
- fixed error with calling memdel
- added return value handling for error-cases
