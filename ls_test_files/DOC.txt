1907
- supported '-a' flag
-> separated files starting with a '.' and all files into different functions (create_list.c)

- started working for -R
-> created 'recursive-print() (ft_ls.c)
-> am now able to print the first subfolder and its content. no recursion yet.

- created ft_strjoin_three (libft)

2007
- erased my recursive_print
-> i think i should list all dirs recursively on the first go, if -R present
managed to list the directories and subdirectories (i think)
> list_directories_only (list.c) AND list_sub_directories (ft_ls.c)

- -R works, sort of

2107
- am able to print file-size for -l now (long_format.c)

2207
- modified time-format printing for long-format (long_format.c) (doesnt support 6MM difference yet)

2407
- long-format supports the 6month difference now
- created sort_time (sort.c), that sorts files in an array given modification time for -t
- started working on my main.c-logic (cleaner version)

2507
- working on my list-building + sorting + printing logic
(apparently ls looks dirty with ls -R ../init/)
- changed the way how printing from paths works
- fixed stat-function params in long_format.c
- can do -l from directory now

2607
- got -R to work (i guess) (print.c)
- changed sort_list (sort.c)
- added char sortc to build (set to 't', 'r' if no t, '0' if no r)

2707
- changed path to file-name for stat-calls in long_format.calls
- changed print.c logic to be more linear
- fixed printing directories with -l
