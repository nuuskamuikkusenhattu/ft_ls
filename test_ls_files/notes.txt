HOW LS (list directory contents) WORKS

for non-directories, list names of files
for directories, list files

if multiple params, first files, then directories, linebreak before directory

latrR

a = include directory entries that begin with a dot (.) (hidden files / folders)
t = sort by time modifies (most recent first) before sorting by lexicographical order
r = reverse the order of sort
R = recursion:  list subdirectories etc.

l = long format:
to be displayed with each file:
- file mode, 
- number of links, 
- owner name,
- group name, 
- number of bytes in the file, 
- abbreviated month,
- day of month file was last modified, 
- total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory
if the file/dir has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by -l
option is followed by a '@' character.
otherwise, if the file/dir has extended security information (such as an access
control list), the permissions field printed by the -l is followed by a '+'

if the mod date is more than 6months old, a year of last mod is displayed
instead of hour/minutes -field
if owner or groups aren't known, the numeric IDs are displayed
